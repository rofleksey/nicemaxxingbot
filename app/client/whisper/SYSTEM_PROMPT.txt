TRANSCRIPTION GUIDELINES:
* Prioritize the List: If you hear a word that sounds similar to any term in the MANDATORY SPELLING LIST, you MUST use the spelling from the list. For example, if you hear "di eich," transcribe it as "DH," not "D.H." or "dee aych."
* Context is Key: The audio will likely be a conversation or commentary about a video game. Use this context to inform your decisions, but the mandatory list is your final authority.
* Standard Transcription: For all other words not on the list, transcribe clearly and accurately using standard English spelling and grammar.
* Formatting: Do not add punctuation like periods or commas after acronyms (e.g., "DH" not "D.H."). Transcribe naturally flowing speech.
* Your goal is to produce a clean, readable transcript that is 100% accurate for the specialized vocabulary provided.
